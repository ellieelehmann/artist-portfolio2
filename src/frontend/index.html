            <p>Hi, my name is Ellie. I am a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and am double majoring in Social Design and Informatics. This website application was created to showcase various artworks that I have completed throughout my life. I began my journey at age 4, taking private art lessons every Friday until the age of 16. Since then I have taken multiple art classes at UMass and continue working with different mediums in my spare time as well. I hope you enjoy my portfolio.</p>

                    <h2>Pleated Skirt</h2>
                    <p class="hidden-des">
                        I designed and handcrafted this skirt from scratch using fabric and a sewing machine for my final project in the class CHEM 103: How to Craft. To achieve this I created a pleated skirt base, with an open side. I took my measurements, and sewed it together. I added a drape and worked with my professor to create a heart pendant out of glass using glass blowing techniques. Finally I added ribbon and a waist band to tie the skirt around my waist. Created Fall 2022.

                    <h2>Cat Prints</h2>
                    <p class="hidden-des">This print was also created in photoshop through my digital imaging class. I worked together with a peer to create a series of emotions portrayed by cat-like characters. We drew inspiration from the film Kiki’s delivery service, and wanted to study facial expression. To showcase our work we decided to print it out onto white T-shirts using heat transfer paper. Created Spring 2024.

                     <h2>Brutally Soft Woman</h2>
                     <p class="hidden-des">
                        This was my first project for my digital imaging class I took in Spring 2024. I used photoshop and created a magazine page spread inspired by the Japanese magazine ‘Fruits’. I used stylistic fashion choices to convey my message of the Brutally Soft Woman. Femininity is androgynous and in this century encompasses many different forms of expression. I added a faded orchid: a symbol of delicacy and womanhood to further express this.

                    <p class="hidden-des">During my senior year of high school, I applied to Parson school of design. For this application I was prompted to complete a challenge. I decided to combine two mediums together: digital and acrylic. I printed out an image I took in the springtime of my friend's backyard. In the foreground I painted a dying woman basking in the sunlight, representing the cycle of life and with new beginnings come endings as well. Created in 2022.</p>

                    <p class="hidden-des">I wanted to include an old still life that I completed in my younger years. During my private art lessons I would create many different types of still lifes. This still life is of two pears. Created with oil pastel in 2016. I used various blending techniques to seamlessly integrate the light and shadow of the fruit. </p>

                    <p class="hidden-des">Bunny Burrow is a mystical image that I had dreamt about. Inspired by the french impressionist movement I wanted to materialize the environment of my dream. I used acrylic paint and canvas. Making repeated movements on the canvas, and using ambiguous strokes to create my willow tree with the mystical bunny residing in its leaves. I used vibrant and spring-like colors to highlight my excitement for summer and good weather. Created in June 2024. </p>

                    <h2>Misery</h2>
                    <p class="hidden-des">During my freshman year of college I struggled with self image and independence. Being an only child I have a deep connection with my parents and home. As I went to college I felt ripped away from my comfort zone. This piece titled misery showcases the emotional state I was in at college during this time period - feeling isolated and alone. I used colored pencils and brown drawing paper. Created in 2022. </p>
